		<h3>What is Nostalgia?</h3>
		<p>According to Arlin Cuncic of <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-nostalgia-5272007#:~:text=Nostalgia%20can%20also%20be%20thought%20of%20as%20%22the,of%20comfort%20in%20times%20of%20sadness%20or%20distress.">verywellmind.com</a>;
			Nostalgia is a sentimentality for the past,typically for a period or place with happy
			personal associations. Nostalgia is usuallytriggered by something reminding an
			individual of an experience from the past. It is often
			characterized as a longing or desire to return to a former time or place.</p>

		<h3>There are 2 types of nostalgia:</h3>
		<p>•	Positive nostalgia is characterized by happy, rose-tinted memories of the past. It is often associated with feelings of warmth, happiness, and comfort. (Arlin Cuncic)</p>
		<p>•	Negative nostalgia, on the other hand, is characterized by bittersweet or even painful memories of the past. It is often associated with longing, sadness, and regret. (Arlin Cuncic)</p>

		<h3>There are also 3 categories of nostalgia:</h3>
		<p>•	Personal nostalgia is characterized by memories of specific people or events from one's own life. (Arlin Cuncic)</p>
		<p>•	Social nostalgia is characterized by memories of a time when one felt more connected to others. (Arlin Cuncic)</p>
		<p>•	Cultural nostalgia is characterized by memories of a time when one felt more connected to their culture. (Arlin Cuncic)</p>

		<h3>Historical Context</h3>
		<p>Nostalgia is a relatively new concept. The word was first coined in 1688 by Swiss physician Johannes Hofer,
			who defined it as a neurological illness of continually thinking about one's homeland and longing for return. (Arlin Cuncic)</p>
		<p>Also, according to Melissa Kirsch of the New York Times, The word, roughly translated from the Greek, means “a longing to return home.”</p>

		<h3>Where to Find It</h3>
		<p>The most obvious place to find nostalgia is in your mind. Memories are a very strong source of nostalgia.
			Besides that, there is a wide variety of products are available nowadays that are meant to evoke nostalgia.
			According to Melissa Kirsch, Nostalgia is easily packaged and sold because it promises to create a community
			out of a cohort. In other words, an abundance of nostalgic products exist because there is a great demand for
			them. Another source of nostalgia is the internet. "The internet is an endlessly renewing nostalgia mine from
			which anyone can, at any time, extract a cultural gemstone — a music video from the early days of MTV, a
			jingle for a product long out of circulation — and post it for all to appreciate." (Melissa Kirsch) Of course,
			there are many other sources of nostalgia, but those are some of the most common places to find it. </p>
